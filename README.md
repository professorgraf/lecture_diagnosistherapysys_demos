# Demo code for lectures in diagnosis, therapy, and assistance-guided systems

Demonstration code (including User Interface) for 
* monte carlo simulation (example approximates PI visually)
* linear interpolation of RGB color values within a grid

In order to run the demos, first setup python environment by installing requirements (currently numpy).
A virtual environment is recommended but not necessary. 

> Install requirements with pip 
>> pip install requirements.txt 

>Start python code (each sample currently is in a single .py file)
> 
> Example: 
>> python monte_carlo_pi.py
